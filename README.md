 Number guessing game

The start_game() method will initialize the game by prompting the user if they want to play. Then according to their answer it will prompt for either a guess or end the game. The game will tell the user whether the answer is higher or lower than the answer. It keeps track of how many times the user guessed so that they will know when the game ends. It will also keep track of the current high score so that the user can see it when the game ends and starts.
